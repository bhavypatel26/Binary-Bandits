# Food Waste and Garbage Reduction System

This project aims to develop a system for  reducing food waste in local areas. The system will involve a website that allows users to  monitor and reduce their food waste by giving the untouched leftovers to someone in need.

We are trying to solve two problems namely reducing food wastage also by reducing the percentage of malnutrition with our model 

The website will have a range of features to help users reduce their food waste and garbage:
 

* Users can input information about their food waste such as the type, quantity, and their address.
* Our volunteers will pick up the untouched leftovers and will provide it to someone in need hence minimizing the food wastage by helping 
   poor.
* Users can view and confirm that their leftover food is given to someone in need through our exclusive feed which shows the videos and 
   photos of our daily work .
* Users can receive tips and advice on how to reduce their food waste.

The website will also have a range of features to help local authorities reduce food waste and garbage in their areas. This includes:

* Local authorities can access the data and conclude which area has more food wastage.
* Local authorities can use the data to create targeted campaigns to reduce food waste and garbage.
* Git-hub : https://github.com/bhavypatel26/Binary-Bandits.git
